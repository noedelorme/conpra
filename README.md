# Conpra: Algorithms for Programming Contests
Conpra is the master level practical course about programming contests at the Technical University of Munich. Each week, for thirteen weeks in a row, there are five problems to solve around the same theoretical concept.

#### Test case contest
A testcase contest for bonus points. See the archive with the solutions to break in the materials. AES-CTR scoring: 2 points for breaking each (almost-reasonable) solution (providing a test case that makes it go outside 4x approximation bound), +1 point for a generator capable to provide many diverse testcases breaking the same solution (please specify what is the success rate), and more (see README.txt inside the archive).
